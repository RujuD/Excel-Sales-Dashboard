âœ… Sub-category performance tracking (% vs Previous Year)

âœ… Geographic sales analysis (California leads!)

âœ… Trend analysis using charts

âœ… Interactive slicers for easy filtering


Building dashboards like this in Excel allows for dynamic data exploration and helps stakeholders quickly grasp key trends and insights. 
Itâ€™s a powerful tool for data visualization and reporting.
